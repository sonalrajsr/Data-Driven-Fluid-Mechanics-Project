# Fluid Dynamics Image Analysis using POD

This repository hosts a Python project that utilizes image processing and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to analyze fluid dynamics from video data. The project includes steps for noise addition, noise reduction, and flow analysis through computational methods in image processing and machine learning.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to extract meaningful insights from video frames capturing fluid dynamics experiments. The specific goals include:
- Extracting frames from video data.
- Applying Gaussian and Speckle noise to simulate varying experimental conditions.
- Implementing noise reduction techniques such as Gaussian blur and Non-Local Means (NLM) denoising.
- Analyzing the fluid flow using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to identify dominant flow modes.
